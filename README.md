# Hi, I'm Moiz

I'm a self ftaught software engineer and entrepreneur based in Toronto. As the founder and principal developer of **Halaali**—a Muslim super app—I build tools to streamline halal dining and related services. What began as a personal need for halal options has evolved into a mission to make halal living more accessible through technology.

## About Halaali

- **Halaali** curates halal restaurants, food trucks and markets worldwide.
- It is community‭‑driven: users contribute reviews, favourites and guides.
- I am currently refining the user experience and releasing features that enhance everyday utility.
