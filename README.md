# Hi, I'm Moiz  
  
I'm a self‑taught developer and entrepreneur from Toronto working on **Halaali**, a community‑driven app for discovering halal food and services. Halaali started as a way to solve my own problem of finding halal options while traveling and has grown into a passion project with a mission to make it easy for Muslims everywhere to find and share great halal experiences.  
  
## About Halaali  
  
- **Halaali** helps people find halal restaurants, food trucks and markets across the world.  
- It's community‑driven: users can share their favourite places, leave reviews and build guides for others.  
- I'm currently focused on improving the app’s user experience and building features that make it useful in everyday life.  
  
## What I'm Up To  
  
- Building new features for Halaali  
- Learning more about design and product development  
- Exploring open‑source tools and sharing what I learn  
  
## Technologies  
  
I enjoy working with:  
  
- TypeScript / JavaScript / Python  
- React & Next.js  
- MongoDB / PostgreSQL / Firebase / Supabase  
- GitHub Actions / Docker / Notion / Figma  
  
Thanks for stopping by! If you're interested in Halaali or have feedback, feel free to reach out or explore my repositories.
