# Hi, I'm Moiz

I'm a self ftaught software engineer and entrepreneur based in Toronto. I'm the founder and developer of **Halaali**, a Muslim super app that helps people discover halal food and related services across the globe. Halaali started as a way to solve my own challenge of finding halal options while traveling and has grown into a passion project to make it easy for Muslims everywhere to find and share great halal experiences.

## About Halaali

- **Halaali** helps people find halal restaurants, food trucks and markets around the world.
- It's community‭‑driven: users can share their favourite places, leave reviews and build guides for others.
- My focus is on continuously improving the app's user experience and building features that make it useful in everyday life.
